Description
-----------

D-Bus development can be quiet painful because of the lack of analysis and
monitoring tools.

The dbus-monitor, while light and quick, may lack some features to you. There is
some other tools out there, but sometimes poorly finished, or coming with too
much requirements and dependencies for compilation or execution that they do not
exactly fit what could be meant by "system development tools".

Dahsee aims to be full featured while being lightweight and simple.
* Built in C.
* There is no dependency but D-Bus and a C library.
* The source code for the main program is a single C file.
* The program is only one executable that is less than 50 KB.

Features:
* D-Bus messages filtering.
* Comprehensive message description: timestamp, arguments, data payload, etc.
* Statistics over scanned massages.
* Comprehensive details about applications registered on the bus.
* The configurable and clear output to terminal can be easily parsed and piped
  to other application (as well as to itself).

Configuration
-------------

The only required dependency is D-Bus. You will need it for compilation and
runtime.

It should compile and run on any POSIX system where D-Bus can run.  Dahsee
should run on any POSIX plateform, but as of 2012-08-09, this still needs
confirmation.

Optionally you will need microhttpd (a.k.a. libmicrohttpd) for the Web
interface.

Specify your compilation and installation option in 'config.mk'.
